# ml_h3n2

Repository for prediction of A/H3N2 mutation for UoG 41X project.

This package is being developed as part of an engineering capstone project, to explore the relevance of statistical models to the mutation of the A/H3N2 virus.

## Data
Data is collected from GISAID, but cannot be hosted due to GISAID's terms of use. Therefore, running this code will require users to apply with GISAID and collect their own data.<br/>
Data should be collected from GISAID using the following Fasta Header:<br/>
```Isolate name | Collection date | Segment |```<br/>
This will include only the useful information without the need to use a library.

<!-- ## Notebooks
Notebooks contained in this repository are intended to be downloaded, and use this package. This approach is subject to change, but is currently one of the most convenient means of tracking updates between group members. Notebooks are to be uploaded with outputs included.

This repository is a work in progress. -->
